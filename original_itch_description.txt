Important: You can also play with arrow keys!

(It's hard to shoot if you use WASD)
Haley Heartbeat

Play as Haley Heartbeat, a young magician walking back to her home, hindered only by EVIL enchanted beings...

Haley Heartbeat is a shoot-em-up game with an added component of rhythm: shoot right as your heart beats to get more powerful shots, and chain good rhythm together for the most powerful projectiles.
Please Download If Possible

Whenever the web version has to load a new kind of special effect (e.g. a bullet), it lag spikes. I tried fixing this but apparently my fix didn't work. I recommend downloading for the best experience. (Unfortunately I was only able to upload the Windows version on time).

My other recommendation is to play with a controller! It's fun! :D
Known Bugs

- You definitely want to return to the main menu after beating the fourth level (the one with the red things). The end-of-level screen refuses to load the fifth level, and will instead replay the fourth level. You can however play the fifth level from the level select if you like.

- The death animation seems to reset every time you get hurt, which might lead to a softlock on screens with enough enemies.

- The win screen and lose screen music repeats; it is meant to only play once.

All code and art assets were made by me during the jam. Most of the sound effects are based on public-domain samples from freesound, as well as a couple generated ones.
